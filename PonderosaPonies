<h1>Ponderosa Ponies!!</h1>
<p>A horse is a versitile animal from the Eqquis family. They are strong,
intelligent, and very social. Interestingly, in a herd, male horses will
protect the females from danger by rearing and kicking. Horses appear in
artwork, myths, and religion. Horses are used for hundreds of applications such
as hunting, pulling carts, races, pleasure riding, dressage, western, and
english riding.

<p>A male horse starts as a colt and once it is older than four years, 
its known as a stallion. A castrated male horse is called a gelding.
A female horse under four years is a filly and after they turn five,
they are called mares.</p>
<p>A horse is measured in hands, four inches per hand, from the hooves,
without shoes, to the withers. Depending on how they are fed, most light horses
are 14 to 16 hands high, larger ones are 15.2 to 17 hands high. Heavy horses
are 16 to 18 hands high. The tallest horse was 21 hands high and the smallest
was 17 inches high.</p>
